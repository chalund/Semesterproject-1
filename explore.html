             <p>We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a <b>Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 </b> where you’ll get to explore and experiment with our team of experts.</p>
             <p>During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message. </p>
