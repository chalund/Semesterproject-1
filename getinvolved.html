            <h2>Volunteer</h2>
            <p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy.</p>
            <p>Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.</p>
            <p>You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you’d like to find out more about how you can get involved.</p>
            <h2>Internships</h2>
            <p>Are you interested in working in a museum? Do you enjoy the fun and excitement of sharing the wonders of nature with people? Well you could be just the right person to enjoy an internship at the museum.</p>
            <p>You’ll be learning from a number of different academics and people who are passionate about science and sharing it with the wider community.</p>
